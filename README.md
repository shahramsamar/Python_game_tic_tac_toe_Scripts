# Python Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python. This project showcases how to create a text-based interactive game that can be played by two players in the terminal.

## Features

- **Two-player Mode**: Play with another player on the same machine.
- **Game Logic**: Detects win conditions and a draw scenario.
- **Interactive Interface**: Easy-to-use, text-based interface in the terminal.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shahramsamar/python_game_tic_tac_toe_Scripts.git
    cd python_game_tic_tac_toe_Scripts
    ```

2. **Run the Game:**

    ```bash
    python tic_tac_toe.py
    ```

### How to Play

- The game board is displayed in the terminal with numbers representing empty positions (1-9).
- Players take turns to enter the position where they want to place their mark (`X` or `O`).
- The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
- The game detects when there is a draw or a winner.

### Project Structure

- `tic_tac_toe.py`: The main script implementing the game logic and interface.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists any additional dependencies (if required).
